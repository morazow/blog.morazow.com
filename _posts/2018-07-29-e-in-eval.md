## Eval in REPL

There are many strategies when evaluating a source code in interpreted
languages.

The most common and easy to implement method is a **tree-walking** interpreter.
Interpreters working in this way just evaluate a provided **Abstract Syntax
Tree** ([AST][ast]). Usually there might be preceding steps to make
optimizations such as rewriting or transforming an AST so that it is more
suitable for repeated or recursive evaluation.

Other interpreters first convert the AST to [bytecode][bytecode]. Bytecode is
composed of opcodes which are similar to mnemonics of assembly language.
However, the bytecode needs to be emulated by a [virtual machine][vm] that is
part of interpreter. This approach can be more performant than a tree-walking
interpreter evaluation.

However, some interpreters do not build an AST at all. The parser directly emits
bytecode and then it gets emulated by a virtual machine.

On the other hand, some programming languages parse a source code, build an AST
and convert the AST to bytecode. But instead of emulating opcodes specified by
bytecode, the VM compiles them into native machine code before executed them -
just in time. Usually these are called [JIT][jit] (just in time) interpreters or
compilers.

Some interpreters recursively traverse the AST but convert specific branches of
it into native code, then execute that branch just in time. Slight variation of
this is where a particular branch is compiled to native code only after
traversing it multiple times.

## Evaluation in Real World Programming Language

[Ruby][ruby] started as a tree-walk interpreter, executing the AST while
traversing it, until version **1.9**. With version 1.9, they introduced a
virtual machine. After that Ruby interpreter parses source code, builds an AST
and then compiles the AST into bytecode which gets interpreted by virtual
machine.

[Lua][lua] started out as an interpreter that compiles to bytecode without
building an AST, and then the bytecode is executed in **register-based** virtual
machine. However, with introduction of [LuaJIT][luajit], the bytecode is
compiled to highly-optimized machine code for several architectures.

## Conclusion

In summary, it is a trade off between performance or portability. If you want a
performant language it is better to choose a bytecode VM that JIT compiles to
native code for different machine architectures. On the other hand, tree-walking
interpreters are less performant but portable since you do not have to target
different architecture, only evaluate an AST.

Many of this material was adopted from Thorsten Ball's [Writing An
Interpreter][monkeylang] book. Additionally, [Crafting Interpreters][ci] by
Robert Nystrom was great help. I thank them both dearly!
