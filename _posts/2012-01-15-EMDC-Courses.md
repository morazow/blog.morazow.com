Introduction
------------

On the summer of 2011 after graduating from [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr) 
Computer Engineering, I have been accepted to European Masters in Distributed Computing 
([EMDC](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/joint/emdc))
joint Erasmus Mundus programme between 
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](http://www.kth.se/) in Sweden, 
[Instituto Superior Técnico in Portugal (IST)](http://www.ist.utl.pt/) and 
[Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/) in Spain. 
It is a two-year Master's programme including compulsory mobility for the students.

I have been accepted to IST - KTH track, which means I will be studying in the Instituto 
Superior Técnico for two semesters and another semester in KTH Royal Institute of Technology 
and for final semester will be doing my thesis in Institute Superior Técnico again. 

After long efforts and procedures of getting visa, I have managed to get to the Lisbon 
and adapt to the beautiful city, to the university and  meet with great friends.

This semester (Fall 2011) at [IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/) I have taken four master's courses, 

* Parallel and Distributed Computing
* Peer-to-Peer Systems and Overlay Networks
* Cloud Computing
* Network and Computer Security

All of these courses were challenging and interesting, I have learned whole new technologies, 
concepts and had hands on practice doing projects.

Parallel and Distributed Computing
----------------------------------

This course was most familiar for me since I had Parallel computing course while 
studying my Bachelor's degree. Nevertheless I have learned new things about 
distributed computing; distributed architecture, OpenMP, MPI, designing and implementing 
distributed and parallel algorithms and analyzing them using several metrics. 

Course project was to implement network slack computation both using OpenMP (shared memory) 
and MPI (distributed memory).

Peer-to-Peer Systems and Overlay Networks
-----------------------------------------

This was one of the interesting courses. Starting from BitTorrent, eMule and then 
learning about unstructured p2p systems, Gnutella; then structures ones, Chord, Pastry, 
Kademia and Can. After that were a little bit challenging, we have studied Gossip, One-hop 
protocols, distance estimation (Vivaldi algorithm), content distribution (Akamai), load 
balancing in p2p systems, etc.

Course project was to design Http p2p proxy.

Cloud Computing
---------------

This course was also very interesting. Starting from clusters, grids and eventually about 
cloud technologies. Implementing mini MapReduce using Hadoop, cloud technologies 
Amazon AWS, Google App Engine and MS Azure. 

Course project was to design and implement mini web indexing system that will be using 
all cloud systems. We, project team, had implemented page-rank algorithm on Amazon EC2,
stored data on MS Azure database and implemented web front-end on Google App Engine 
communicating with Azure database. Trying and learning these was very interesting.

Network and Computer Security
-----------------------------

This course was my least interesting. We have learned lots of protocols and key encryption 
algorithms, both symmetrical and asymmetrical. Moreover, about the network certification 
organizations.


Since semester is over and we had first round of exams (hope we pass them) 
we can concentrate to the next learning adventures.
